# Visualization Dashboard

Nodesphere is an ambitious project designed to connect all of the data sources that we care about into a single unified dashboard.

Nodesphere is a collection of isomorphic visualization-style interfaces. Each interface has particular strengths, so the user can switch between interfaces depending upon the data set and the desired interaction style.

# Semantic Crunching

The core engine of Nodesphere is a semantic crunching algorithm which reduces data inputs into their atomic semantic nodes. What this means is that regardless of the data source, the important data is in a semantic graph, with appropriate connections between tags, categories, peoples names etc.

# Plugin Ecosytem

On top of this core engine, rest a rich ecosystem of open source adapters, allowing us to pull data from the API's of our most common collaboration tools.

Nodesphere is backed by permanent content addressable file systems like Camlistore, and interplanetary file system.

# Open Graph

- Storage layer: interplanetary file system - permanent storage
- Personal graph server: graph database - cache of data currently in use by an individual or organization
- Visualization layer: allows filtering, sensemaking and visual navigation of data

# Data Ownership

Nodesphere allows us to take back our data. Imagine working in a tight-knit core of half a dozen collaborators -- their work is spread through multiple software systems: perhaps Github, Trello, Twitter, and Slack. Nodesphere gives a single unified interface to make sense of all of the data agregated in realtime from multiple sources, and allows us to fluidly navigate to the original source application. Nodesphere does not want to take over our personal data, it wants to connect the data that is currently in a variety of silos, bringing it together into a single unified dashboard.

# Project Status

Nodesphere is in active developement, focussing on:

- Multiple visualization interfaces
- Morphing between visualizations
- Reading data from multiple backends, starting with IPFS
