## Unified Dashboard

Nodesphere is an ambitious project designed to connect all of the data sources that you care about into a single unified dashboard.

Nodesphere is a collection of isomorphic visualization style interfaces. Each interface has particular strengths, so the user can switch between interfaces depending upon the data set and the desired interaction style.

## Data Ownership

Nodesphere allows you to take back your data. Imagine you are working in a tight-knit core of half a dozen collaborators. Your work is spread through multiple software systems &mdash; perhaps Github, Trello, Twitter, and Slack. Nodesphere gives you a single unified interface to make sense of all of the data agregated in realtime from multiple sources, and allows you to fluidly navigate to the original source application. Nodesphere does not want to take over your personal data, it wants to connect the data that is currently in a variety of silos, bringing it together into a single unified dashboard.

## Semantic Crunching

The core engine of Nodesphere is semantic crunching algorithm which reduces any data inputs to its atomic semantic nodes. What this means is that regardless of the data source , the important data is in a semantic graph, with appropriate connections between tags categories people's names etc.

## Plugin Ecosytem 

On top of this core engine, rest a rich ecosystem of open source adapters, allowing us to pull data from the API's of our most common collaboration tools. 

Nodesphere is backed by permanent content addressable file systems like get gamma camera store, and interplanetary file system.

## Open Graph

Everything in Nodesphere is a graph, and graph databases

- storage layer: interplanetary file system - permanent storage
- Personal graph server: graph database - cash of data currently in use by an individual or organization
- visualization layer: allows filtering sensemaking and visual navigation of data
